# Welcome to Selenish Web Dictionary! (SF Lang Dictionary)

A web project to show information about a conlang called Selenish (Kānann Sēlenfolð). This a very personal project where I can show a virtual dictionary and plenty more comming soon of this conlang.

Selenish, or in it's native language, **Kānann Sēlenfolð**, is a conlang created as part of a fantasy history. This is the language spoken by the Selenia Kingdom, inspired on Celtic Languages and Old Norse, with a bit of taste of plenty other languages (Like Japanese or Nahuatl).

My main goal with this world is to create videogames and stories, starting with a standarization of it's language.

## Search for a word and information about it
